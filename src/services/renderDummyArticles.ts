                            <h3>CONTROL-KNOBS RECEIVE IF DESIGN AWARD 2022</h3>
                            <p>
                                The CONTROL-KNOBS range of tuning knobs received the prestigious iF product design award in 2022.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For OKW, it is particularly important to express the high quality of the products through their design. New product developments therefore demonstrate a finely-tuned combination of functionality, aesthetics and ergonomics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Customers praise the innovative design and touch sensation, according to the first feedback on the CONTROL-KNOBS since they were launched on the market in 2021. Control units should not only be easy to handle, users should also want to touch the operating elements. This is the added value that CONTROL-KNOBS offer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "This design award is now the icing on the cake," says Kay Hirmer, responsible for strategic product management at OKW Geh√§usesysteme.
